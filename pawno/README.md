This is a pack of 14 anticheats and 3 helping systems which you can control through callbacks mentioned
in the includes and the test.pwn file.

UPDATED: August 30th - 2018

`Installation`: You simply include the files in your gamemode/fs depending on the include's setup (some require include in all scripts and only edit through
the gamemode, others can be used in one script alone).

`Testing`: All can be done through the test.pwn folder which already contains all of the includes and their callbacks nottify you through `SCM` and `print` messages

`Version`: `7.0`

# Installation

Simply install to your project:

```bash
sampctl package install RogueDrifter/Anti_cheat_pack
```

Include in your code and begin using the library:

```pawn
#include <Anti_cheat_pack>
```

# Usage

Use the callbacks provided to you by the includes depending on the type of it.

The includes are 2 types as mentioned before, some edit only through gamemode and include everywhere.

Others done through a single script whether its the GM/FS.

If you're including the pack as a whole you'll need to only use the callbacks through the GM, you'll still need to include the Anti_cheat_pack everywhere.

If you use separate includes you can edit through usage through the files.

# Testing

Use the test.pwn file and check the server for client messages/log for printed messages.

To test, simply run the package:

```bash
sampctl package run
```

## Non sampctl users:
Go get sampctl! 

But for now:

1- Download the repository.  
2- Take all of the .inc files and put them in your pawno/include.  
3- Open all your filterscripts, use #include <Anti_cheat_pack> right after #include a_samp.  
4- Open your gamemode and type the same line as above^.  
5- Keep your gamemode open and use the callbacks from the post as examples to will.  

And that's about it! every time i announce a new version release just re-do those steps above.
